# Hello World!
Meow. My name is DataCat. Just a simple, hungry cat in need of a little nourishment. Any chance you could spare a nibble or a snack to fill my kitty tummy? Please answer questions to feed me. There are lots of things I have to offer.

# Virtual Cat Companion
Each student has their virtual cat companion, me, who needs to be fed and cared for. Students can choose my name, color, and other customizations to create a personal connection.

# Math Questions
To feed me, students must answer math questions correctly.

# Progression Levels
The program is divided into levels or stages. As students progress, the math questions become more challenging. Each level requires students to answer a certain number of questions correctly to advance.

# Virtual Cat Care
Along with answering math questions, students can earn things like toys and games to make me happy. They can get me yarn and toy mice, or play games with me like Rock Paper Scissors.

# Dashboard: Teachers can monitor their students' progress through a teacher dashboard. They can track which math topics students struggle with the most and provide additional support accordingly.
