# Virtual C4T Companion
Each student has their virtual C4T, who needs to be fed and cared for. You can choose their name, color, and other features to create a personal connection.

# Math Questions
To feed, students must answer math questions correctly. This will earn them points that they can use to buy treats or other things that will make them very happy.
